fun [SincMatrix](../sincmaths/-sinc-matrix/index.md).[sgolayfilter](sgolayfilter.md)(B: [SincMatrix](../sincmaths/-sinc-matrix/index.md)): [SincMatrix](../sincmaths/-sinc-matrix/index.md)  
More info  


This function is like Octave's sgolayfilt, except that instead of order and filter length Savitzky-Golay a pre-computed projection matrix ([B](sgolayfilter.md)) is supplied.
